#' whassocr: An Implementation of Whitehead's Association Analysis
#'
#' This package implements Whitehead's method for analyzing
#' association data. While Whitehead developed these techniques for animal
#' associations, this package is agnostic as to the nature of the data, but
#' assumes data are generally structured as entities in columns and
#' observations in rows, with cells=c(0,1) indicating whether entities
#' were observed during the row observation.
