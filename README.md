Implementation of Whitehead's association network analysis

This is an R package for doing network analysis of associations based on techniques developed by [Hal Whitehead](http://whitelab.biology.dal.ca/hw/hal.htm).

This package is currently under development and is not fully documented. Documented functions should work, 
undocumented functions are not guaranteed to work.

The lar and nulllar functions do not work if the observational data are not aggregated. I am working on fixing this.

I will replace this README with a Vingette once I finish building and documenting the package. I will also publish this package
on CRAN at that point.
