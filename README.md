Implementation of Whitehead's association network analysis

This is an R package for doing network analysis of associations based on techniques developed by [Hal Whitehead](http://whitelab.biology.dal.ca/hw/hal.htm).

This package is currently under development and is not fully documented. Documented functions should work, 
undocumented functions are not guaranteed to work.

I will replace this README with a Vingette once I finish building and documenting the package. I will also publish this package
on CRAN at that point.
