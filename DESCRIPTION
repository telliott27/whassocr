Description: This package implements Whitehead's method for analyzing
    association data. While Whitehead developed these techniques for animal
    associations, this package is agnostic as to the nature of the data, but
    assumes data are generally structured as entities in columns and
    observations in rows, with cells=c(0,1) indicating whether entities
    were observed during the row observation.
